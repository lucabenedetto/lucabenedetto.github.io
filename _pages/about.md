Hello! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge, working within the Department of Computer Science and Technology.
I am a member of the [NLIP](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) (Natural Language and Information Processing) research group and the Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment ([ALTA](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/#)), as well as being affiliated with the [Cambridge Language Sciences](https://www.languagesciences.cam.ac.uk/) Interdiscriplinary Research Centre.

## Research interest

My focus is on the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to the educational domain, primarily working on the automated generation and calibration of exam content, the modelling of students' knowledge levels, and adaptive learning.
