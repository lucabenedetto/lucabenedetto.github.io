Hi there! 
I work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI for Education as [Maître de conférence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent#France) at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), a member school of [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/). 
Before that, I was a Research Associate at at the ALTA Institute of the University of Cambridge (within the [NLIP](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) group), and obtained my PhD from Politecnico di Milano, supervised by Prof. Paolo Cremonesi.


## Research interest

My focus is on the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to the educational domain, primarily working on the automated generation and calibration of exam content, the modelling of students' knowledge levels, and adaptive learning.
