Hello! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Technology and the ALTA institute.

## Research interest

My focus is on the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to the educational domain, primarily working on the automated generation and calibration of exam content, the modelling of students' knowledge levels, and adaptive learning.
