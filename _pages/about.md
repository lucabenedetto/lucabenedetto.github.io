Hi there! 
I work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI for Education as [Maître de conférence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent#France) at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), a member school of [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/). 
Before that, I was a Research Associate at at the ALTA Institute of the University of Cambridge (within the [NLIP](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) group), and obtained my PhD from Politecnico di Milano, supervised by Prof. Paolo Cremonesi.


## Research interest

My research is centered on Natural Language Processing and AI for Education; specifically, I focus on AI Fairness and Safety, computational psychometrics, and the automated generation and evaluation of learning and assessment content.
