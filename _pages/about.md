Hi there! 
I work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI for Education as [Maître de conférence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent#France) at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/), a member school of [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), and visiting researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).

Before joining IP Paris, I was a Research Associate at at the [Cambridge ALTA Institute](https://www.languagesciences.cam.ac.uk/departments/alta-institute) (within the [NLIP](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) and [LHI](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/lhi) groups), worked as a Data Scientist in Cloud Academy (now acquired by [QA Ltd](https://www.qa.com/)), and obtained my PhD from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), supervised by Prof. [Paolo Cremonesi](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/people/details/159156).


## Research interest

My research is centered on Natural Language Processing and AI for Education; specifically, I focus on AI Fairness and Safety, computational psychometrics, and the automated generation and evaluation of learning and assessment content.
